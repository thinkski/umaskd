umaskd v1.0
Last modified on June 22, 2012

Overview
========
umaskd is a utility which implements per-directory umasks. Normally, a single
umask applies to all of a user's new files.


If you're reading this, then you've probably run into the following problem
before: you scp a file over to your ~/public_html directory only to foget to
then chmod it to be go+r, making it inaccessible to the webserver.

This tool is intended to make such problems a thing of the past.

Configuration File
==================
By default, the ${prefix}/etc/umaskd.conf file contains directory umask
settings. Using the -f or --file option, a different file can be specified.

The format of the configuration file is one directory setting per row. Each
row should contain a three or four digit umask followed by whitespace and
then the directory path. For example:

0077 /home/chris
0022 /home/chris/public_html
